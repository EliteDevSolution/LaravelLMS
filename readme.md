## Laravel Roles Permissions Admin - Spatie version

__Update October 2019__: this project was created in 2017 as Laravel 5.4 version, and now we upgraded it to Laravel 6 version, also changed the design theme from [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) to [CoreUI](https://coreui.io)

- - - - -

This is a Laravel 6 adminpanel starter project with roles-permissions management based on [Spatie Laravel-permission package](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission), [CoreUI](https://coreui.io) and [Datatables.net](https://datatables.net).

We've also created almost identical project based on Joseph Silber's Bouncer package: [see here](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/laravel-roles-permissions-bouncer)

Part of this project was generated automatically by [QuickAdminPanel system](https://quickadminpanel.com/).

## Usage

This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit database credentials there
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed` (it has some seeded data - see below)
- That's it: launch the main URL and login with default credentials `admin@admin.com` - `password`

This boilerplate has one role (`administrator`), one permission (`admin_permission`) and one administrator user.

With that user you can create more roles/permissions/users, and then use them in your code, by using functionality like `Gate` or `@can`, as in default Laravel, or with help of Spatie's package methods.
